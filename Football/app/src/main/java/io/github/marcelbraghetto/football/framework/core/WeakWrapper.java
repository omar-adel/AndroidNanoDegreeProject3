/**
 * Created by Marcel Braghetto on 02/12/15.
 *
 * This class is used to wrap a weak reference
 * around an interface to allow calls to be
 * made on it regardless of whether it is null
 * or not. This avoids a massive amount of
 * null checking when trying to call methods
 * on interfaces.
 *
 * This wrapper is only used in special conditions
 * where it is acceptable for it to swallow
 * some specific exceptions (such as null pointer
 * exceptions).
