 * Created by Marcel Braghetto on 02/12/15.
 *
 * A way to make a runnable execute on the main
 * thread. This provider is to give a quick and
 * easy way to do this without littering lots
 * of duplicated boilerplate main thread code.
 *
 * It also allows for calling a runnable on the
 * main thread if you are not running within
 * an Activity context etc.
