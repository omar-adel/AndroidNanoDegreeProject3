This app was developed as part of the 2015 Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

The assignment was to take an existing project (named Football Scores) and make it 'production ready'.

I redeveloped the app from the ground up (I wasn't happy with some of the code in the sample app). Because I decided to start again from scratch, I named the app Football Scores Redux as it was 'born again'.

The main points of interest in this app are:

- Use of an IntentService coupled with an AlarmManager to keep the football scores up to date periodically.
- Inclusion of an Android home screen widget to show the scores for today, which should sync with any updates caused by the IntentService.
- Swipe to refresh in the app.
- Overhaul of the UI.

I also made a deliberate decision to NOT include any team badges, because the sample app only had a small handful of them and it looked really bad only seeing a team badge rarely in the list items.

Overall I really enjoyed having the chance to play around with IntentServices, AlarmManagers, Widgets, Receivers etc and meshing them with a code design pattern I use quite often (all the *Controller classes, kind of an MVP pattern in a way).

Peace!
