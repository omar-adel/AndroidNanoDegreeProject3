# Android NanoDegree Project 3 - Super Duo

These projects are my submission to the Udacity Android NanoDegree coursework.

## App 1 - Alexandria Redux

The first app is named 'Alexandria Redux' and is a book tracking app that allows for scanning ISBN barcodes etc.

This app uses the Google Play Vision APIs to allow for barcode scanning and it worked pretty well!

## App 2 - Football Scores Redux

The second app is named 'Football Scores Redux' and is a football score tracking app which downloads current football 'fixtures' and their results.

Interesting things about this app are:

1. The use of IntentService components alongside the AlarmManager system to have background data syncing periodically.
2. An Android home screen widget to show football scores outside the app.
3. The use of content providers to feed both the app and the widget data sources.

Note: If you want to compile and run this app, you will need to obtain your own API key from the football API website:

http://api.football-data.org/index

and place it into the 'api_keys.xml' values file.
