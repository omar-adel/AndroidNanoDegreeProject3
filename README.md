Udacity Android Developer Nano Degree Project 3 - Super Duo

These projects are for my submission to the Udacity Android NanoDegree.

The first app is named 'Alexandria' and is a book tracking app that allows for scanning ISBN barcodes etc.

I am still working on the second app (football app) and it should be up soon.

Feel free to rifle through my code and use anything you might find useful.
